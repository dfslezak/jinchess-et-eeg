*********** Install Java ***********
************************************

1. Check whether you already hava Java installed by typing "java -version" at
   the commandline. The Java version should be 1.4 or greater.
   IMPORTANT: The result should not say something about "gcj" or "kaffe". If
   it does, what you have is an incomplete Java implementation which cannot
   run Jin. You will need to install a good version.
2. If you don't, Install Java from:
   * Linux - http://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp
   * FreeBSD - http://www.freebsd.org/java/
   * Solaris - http://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp
   * For other systems, I can only suggest a websearch for a 1.4 compatible JVM.

*********** Install Jin ***********
***********************************

1. Extract the tar.gz file you downloaded into some directory (if you got this
   file from the tar.gz file, then you're done :-)).

2. Make sure that the "java" binary is in your PATH. If you have one of the
   latest versions of Java installed, that will usually already be the case.
   Type "java -version" in a shell to see whether it works and to find the
   version of Java you have.
   If you don't have it in your PATH and don't know how to add it, ask in
   channel 212 on ICC, channel 85 on FICS, a newsgroup or #linuxnewbies on IRC.

3. Change to the jin directory (this will usually be in the format
   jin-<version> (jin-2.14 for example) and run Jin with "./jin". You can also
   create a symlink to the jin script in your ~/bin directory. If the jin script
   doesn't work for you for some reason, you can also run Jin with
   "java -jar jin.jar" from Jin's directory (the last part is important).

4. See http://www.jinchess.com/wiki/index.php/Browser_(Unix) for information
   on setting your BROWSER variable. Setting it properly allows Jin to open URLs
   when you click them in your preferred browser.

5. If you run Jin using a shortcut in your favorite desktop environment, Jin
   comes with a nice icon (icon.png in the main directory) for you to use.

6. If you encounter any bugs, want to ask for a certain feature or ask any 
   general question about Jin, see the sourceforge project page at
   https://sourceforge.net/projects/jin/ or email me directly at
   msasha@engineer.com.

6. Enjoy! (or Profit!!!) :-)
